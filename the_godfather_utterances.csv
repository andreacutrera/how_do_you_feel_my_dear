L593445,You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.,HAGEN,L593443,L593444

L593425,Yes.,HAGEN,L593422,L593424
L593423,Good.  He never doubted you.,HAGEN,L593422,L593422
L593421,"You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.",HAGEN,L593420,L593420
L593432,"I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.",DON CORLEONE,L593431,L593431

L592862,Good.  From me you'll get Justice.,DON CORLEONE,L592861,L592861
L592860,"Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...",DON CORLEONE,L592858,L592859
L592858,"You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.",DON CORLEONE,L592858,
L592856,But your daughter is still alive.,DON CORLEONE,L592852,L592855

L592851,And what is that Bonasera?,DON CORLEONE,L592849,L592850
L592849,"Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.",DON CORLEONE,L592849,
L593724,"Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.",MICHAEL,L593722,L593723
L593722,"Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?",MICHAEL,L593722,
L593721,"Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.",MICHAEL,L593719,L593720
L593719,You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?,MICHAEL,L593719,
L593718,You have to answer for Santino.,MICHAEL,L593717,L593717
L593704,Go back to your house and wait for me...,MICHAEL,L593703,L593703

L593325,The gun will be there.,CLEMENZA,L593324,L593324
L593324,"I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.",SONNY,L593324,
L593235,"OK, but be careful.",SONNY,L593234,L593234
L593234,Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.,CLEMENZA,L593234,
L593229,You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.,CLEMENZA,L593228,L593228
L593228,You take care of Paulie?,SONNY,L593228,
L593185,"Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.",SONNY,L593183,L593184
L593184,Understood.,CLEMENZA,L593183,L593183
L593183,Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?,SONNY,L593183,
L593099,"No, just you and Paulie.",SONNY,L593090,L593098
L593098,That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?,CLEMENZA,L593090,L593097
L593097,"Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.",SONNY,L593090,L593096
L593096,"Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...",CLEMENZA,L593090,L593095
L593095,How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?,SONNY,L593090,L593094
L593094,Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.,CLEMENZA,L593090,L593093
L593093,"Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?",SONNY,L593090,L593092
L593092,The word is out in the streets that he's dead.,CLEMENZA,L593090,L593091
L593091,Yeah.,SONNY,L593090,L593090
L593090,You heard about your father?,CLEMENZA,L593090,
L593628,Maybe less...,MICHAEL,L593626,L593627
L593627,Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?,CLEMENZA,L593626,L593626
L593626,"He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.",MICHAEL,L593626,
L593620,"No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.",MICHAEL,L593619,L593619
L593619,We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.,CLEMENZA,L593619,
L593312,"Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...",CLEMENZA,L593310,L593311
L593311,How bad will it be?,MICHAEL,L593310,L593310
L593310,Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.,CLEMENZA,L593310,
L593208,"Maybe, or you gotta know now.",CLEMENZA,L593207,L593207
L593202,"OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.",CLEMENZA,L593201,L593201

L593024,No.,DON CORLEONE,L593022,L593023
L593022,"No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.",DON CORLEONE,L593022,
L593018,"So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?",DON CORLEONE,L593017,L593017

L593651,Maybe I can help.,HAGEN,L593650,L593650
L593650,"Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.",DON CORLEONE,L593650,
L593461,"Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.",DON CORLEONE,L593456,L593460
L593460,He was the one behind Sollozzo?,HAGEN,L593456,L593459
L593459,Barzini.,DON CORLEONE,L593456,L593458
L593458,You mean Tattaglia.,HAGEN,L593456,L593457
L593457,"Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.",DON CORLEONE,L593456,L593456
L593456,When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?,HAGEN,L593456,
L593439,Now you've had your drink.,DON CORLEONE,L593435,L593438
L593438,Yes.,HAGEN,L593435,L593437
L593437,But you needed a drink first.,DON CORLEONE,L593435,L593436

L593435,"My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.",DON CORLEONE,L593435,

L593029,What is this nonsense?,DON CORLEONE,L593029,
L592976,I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.,HAGEN,L592973,L592975
L592975,"No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?",DON CORLEONE,L592973,L592974
L592974,"They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?",HAGEN,L592973,L592973
L592973,When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?,DON CORLEONE,L592973,
L592949,It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.,HAGEN,L592946,L592948
L592948,No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.,DON CORLEONE,L592946,L592947
L592947,Should I bring him in.,HAGEN,L592946,L592946

L592942,When did he call?,DON CORLEONE,L592939,L592941
L592941,"Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.",HAGEN,L592939,L592940
L592940,And with prison record.,DON CORLEONE,L592939,L592939
L592939,"He's his own boss, and very competent.",HAGEN,L592939,

L592936,I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.,DON CORLEONE,L592936,
L592890,You understand him better than anyone.,HAGEN,L592889,L592889
L592889,Is it necessary?,DON CORLEONE,L592889,

L593657,Barzini will move against you first.,DON CORLEONE,L593657,
L593656,"There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out ""Kill me, kill me.""  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.",DON CORLEONE,L593654,L593655
L593655,I'll need him.,MICHAEL,L593654,L593654

L593551,"You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.",DON CORLEONE,L593541,L593550

L593298,"I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.",HAGEN,L593298,
L593297,"No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?",SONNY,L593286,L593296
L593296,"Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...",HAGEN,L593286,L593295
L593295,And when they shot me father...,SONNY,L593286,L593294
L593294,"Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.",HAGEN,L593286,L593293
L593293,Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.,SONNY,L593286,L593292
L593292,The other families won't sit still for all out war.,HAGEN,L593286,L593291
L593291,"No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.",SONNY,L593286,L593290
L593290,We should hear what they have to say.,HAGEN,L593286,L593289
L593289,Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.,SONNY,L593286,L593288
L593288,What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?,HAGEN,L593286,L593287
L593287,"Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.",SONNY,L593286,L593286
L593286,Was there a definite proposal?,HAGEN,L593286,
L593187,"OK forget it, just stay on the phone.",SONNY,L593186,L593186
L593186,Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.,HAGEN,L593186,
L593173,"OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.",SONNY,L593167,L593172
L593172,We're all tired...,HAGEN,L593167,L593171
L593171,"Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.",SONNY,L593167,L593170
L593170,I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.,HAGEN,L593167,L593169
L593169,That's easy to say; it's not your father.,SONNY,L593167,L593168
L593168,"Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.",HAGEN,L593167,L593167
L593167,"Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?",SONNY,L593167,
L593165,"Luca never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he's through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's number.",HAGEN,L593161,L593164
L593164,"No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.",SONNY,L593161,L593163
L593163,Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?,HAGEN,L593161,L593162
L593162,If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.,SONNY,L593161,L593161
L593161,What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.,HAGEN,L593161,
L593159,The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.,SONNY,L593158,L593158
L593158,Is the hospital covered?,HAGEN,L593158,
L592963,Okay.  One minute.,SONNY,L592962,L592962
L592962,The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.,HAGEN,L592962,
L593376,"Mama, no.",HAGEN,L593375,L593375
L593371,"If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.",HAGEN,L593370,L593370
L593367,An accident.  No one was hurt.,HAGEN,L593366,L593366
L593365,"Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.",HAGEN,L593363,L593364
L593363,"Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...",HAGEN,L593363,
L593124,I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.,HAGEN,L593121,L593123

L593009,I'm German-Irish.,HAGEN,L593005,L593008
L593007,He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?,HAGEN,L593005,L593006
L593005,"Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.",HAGEN,L593005,
L593684,"A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.",MICHAEL,L593678,L593683
L593683,Have you agreed on a meeting?,HAGEN,L593678,L593682
L593682,I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.,MICHAEL,L593678,L593681
L593681,How will they come at you?,HAGEN,L593678,L593680
L593680,Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?,MICHAEL,L593678,L593679
L593679,Did he give you his politicians?,HAGEN,L593678,L593678
L593678,"Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.",MICHAEL,L593678,
L593649,"OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...",HAGEN,L593645,L593648
L593648,You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.,MICHAEL,L593645,L593647
L593647,"Mike, why am I out?",HAGEN,L593645,L593646
L593646,Not so perfectly if you noticed.,MICHAEL,L593645,L593645
L593645,Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.,HAGEN,L593645,
L593642,"I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?",HAGEN,L593640,L593641
L593641,"Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.",MICHAEL,L593640,L593640
L593640,"Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?",HAGEN,L593640,
L593303,Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.,MICHAEL,L593302,L593302
L593302,What about McCluskey?,HAGEN,L593302,
L593049,Right.,HAGEN,L593047,L593048
L593048,"No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?",MICHAEL,L593047,L593047
L593047,Sure.  Anything I can do for you.,HAGEN,L593047,

L593240,I don't think so either.  I better go.,MICHAEL,L593236,L593239
L593238,I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.,MICHAEL,L593236,L593237
L593236,Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.,MICHAEL,L593236,

L593223,I can't...,MICHAEL,L593223,
L593221,Huh?,MICHAEL,L593218,L593220
L593219,"Yeah Kay, I'm here.",MICHAEL,L593218,L593218
L593216,He'll be OK.,MICHAEL,L593214,L593215

L593062,No.,MICHAEL,L593061,L593061
L593044,"Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.",MICHAEL,L593043,L593043
L593041,"Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.",MICHAEL,L593036,L593040
L593039,For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.,MICHAEL,L593036,L593038

L593033,And what do you want for Christmas?,MICHAEL,L593032,L593032
L592953,He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.,MICHAEL,L592950,L592952
L592951,Sure.,MICHAEL,L592950,L592950

L592921,...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.,MICHAEL,L592911,L592920
L592919,Then Luca turned to the other man...,MICHAEL,L592911,L592918
L592917,Then the thighs where they joined the torso.,MICHAEL,L592911,L592916
L592915,Then the legs at the knees...,MICHAEL,L592911,L592914
L592913,"My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...",MICHAEL,L592911,L592912
L592911,"Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.",MICHAEL,L592911,
L592910,Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.,MICHAEL,L592904,L592909
L592908,You like spaghetti?,MICHAEL,L592904,L592907

L593256,You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?,MICHAEL,L593255,L593255

L593305,"They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.",MICHAEL,L593304,L593304
